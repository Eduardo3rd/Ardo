# Ardo
 The place where I make art in public.

 For now I'm grouping my work into a few rough but self-explanatory topics. Poke around the folders to see what I'm up to at any given time. I've made ~90% of my work while I've been traveling in the past. I don't expect that to change any time soon. Expect something new roughly every couple of months if that holds true going forward. 
 
 You can read a little bit about why I create art in this [blog post](http://www.torrealba.io/blog/2020/7/3/artist). A few examples of my past work are highlighted on [this page](http://www.torrealba.io/art) as well as on my [instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/ardokotvg/).
